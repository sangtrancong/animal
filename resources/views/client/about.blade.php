                <p>We are animalstories, we share for you all animal stories. So that people can be happy and alive, but also they want to feel in tune with their bodies from birth till death; being free of fear or shameâ€¦ But as I say it is not a metaphor about our skin anymore because when someone dies my brother has become dead myself too.. I have taken this idea over into creating something else (or what's left) by writing an Animal-centric book on the same topic: The First People Are Not Animals Book series! It will cover topics like Evolution, How Do They Live?, Why do You Have An Attachment To Your Pet?...and more! My friends who were looking at me</p>
